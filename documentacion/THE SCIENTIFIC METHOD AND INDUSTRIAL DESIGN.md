[The Scientific Method and Industrial Design — formerly ECI Screenprint](https://www.eciscreenprint.com/blog/2015/7/31/the-scientific-method-and-industrial-design)

The Scientific Method is used to answer a question by creating a hypothesis and testing it with a series of experiments. The scientific method can be used in several different situations, which also includes the process of Industrial design. This article will take you step by step through the scientific method as it compares the process to how industrial design can be approached.

 The scientific method is significant to industrial design because it helps designers by setting up a grounded process that they can follow as a kind of guide in order to find the solution to design problems. The scientific method not only acts as a guide but can help continually improve a product/design. New solutions are always possible with new technology always being discovered. Possibilities are endless and the scientific method allows designers to take old ideas and create new ones. Designers are always on the lookout for progress and it all starts with asking the right questions and adding new variables to experimentation and testing. It is important to note that most progress and opportunities – in all areas of technology – usually have their basis in using the scientific method. Thomas Edison believed that even failed hypotheses can create opportunities which will eventually end up providing the impetus for new products that will improve and change our lives, stating, “I have not failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work.” Thus, the light bulb was invented which we continue to improve upon today

## What is the Scientific Method?

Think back to elementary school. Every year most schools have something called the “Science Fair”. You would have to get one of those big tri-fold display boards and decorate it with some type of experiment you were supposed to carry out. Basically, this is a way for children to come up with a problem or theory to test, test the theory and then present the data as conclusions. The whole point of this is to instill the scientific method into children. The principles of this exercise are used by adults in research and industry, although they have traded out the tri-fold displays for PowerPoints and white papers. Let’s explore the scientific method in a little more detail.

There are many variants and wordings for the scientific method. For the purpose of this writing, we will stick to five major steps.

\1.    **Identify the problem or question** – This step is the beginning of the entire process. What are you trying to solve? These questions or problems usually come from observed phenomena. Over the years people have asked questions such as what are clouds made of? How do birds fly? Why did the apple fall from the tree and hit me in the head? That last question specifically led to the discovery of gravity, all from asking a question. A clear, well formulated problem or question needs to be specific enough to be tested and proven or disproven.  

\2.    **Hypothesis** – Now that there is a question or problem to solve, this step seeks to address the question and formulate a theory to test. Basically, the experimenter must come up with a potential reason for the observed phenomena. This is usually something driven by the evidence on hand so far. Getting the hypothesis usually requires some thinking, knowledge or possibly existing data. This theory must be explicitly stated and able to be tested. If it cannot be tested, it cannot be proven.

\3.    **Prediction / Research** – Depending on the word you use, this step usually relates to studying your question and collecting some more information and data. Basically, the experimenter here is trying to think of the consequences of the hypothesis and use this to describe the phenomenon to test. If my hypothesis is true, then I would see this….This step could require gaining some knowledge and researching information for the prediction.

\4.    **Experiment / Testing** – In this step, a controlled experiment is put in place to test the prediction and hypothesis. In almost any experiment, there is a control and there is a test subject. The control is meant to be the baseline case that does not prove a hypothesis while the test subject injects elements from the prediction meant to validate the hypothesis. Key example of this is testing medications for side effects. A control group is given a placebo while a test group is given a medication to see if they have a certain reaction. If both groups experienced a reaction or no reaction, then the hypothesis cannot be proven. The hypothesis in this case would be the medication causes measles. The prediction would say measles would form on the skin after taking medication. The experiment would test if people that took the medication had a measles outbreak. The two groups would then be compared to see if the medication leads to increased cases of measles in the sample. Measurable variables need to be defined for the experiment to generate data later used for analysis.

\5.    **Analysis / Presentation** – This last step takes the data from the experiment conducted earlier and performs analysis to either prove or reject the hypothesis. It is common here to use statistical testing to confirm the data shows a statistical difference and is not the victim of variation. The results of the experiment could also drive the creation of some type of model explaining the phenomena being studied. This step often takes data and visualizes it in a graph for presentation. Once the conclusion is reached, then the presentation of the answer is provided. This is often in the form of a paper or publication. If no conclusion is reached or more experimentation is needed, prior steps may be revisited. The hypothesis may need to be refined or changed or the experiment may not have been controlled or statistically significant enough. Either way, there are multiple possibilities at this step.

The purpose of all of this is to make a discovery or come up with an answer that can be proven with data. This process is the background for innovation and discovery. Interestingly enough, this process is more common than many people think. It is represented in many different forms in business and engineering under different names.

## Applications in Business

\1.    **DMAIC** – This process is used in Six Sigma and stands for Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control. In this process, a problem is formulated, research is performed and data collected about the problem. The analyze phase is a little misleading, it is really the hypothesis stage in which a hypothesis is formulated and tested using statistical testing methods such as the student t-test, ANOVA, Design of Experiments etc…Once the hypothesis is proven, a solution is generated during the improve phase. Last, the control stage presents the findings and the resulting solution. It is easy to see the parallel with the scientific method.

\2.    **PDCA / A3** – Lean philosophy has something similar called PDCA. It stands for plan, do, check and act. It is a simplified version of DMAIC in which a problem, question or mission is identified in the plan stage. Next, solutions or changes are generated and experiments or pilots are carried out. The results are checked and the act stage either shows the process repeating or the solution is implemented. The A3 method is also from lean and is similar to PDCA, but more formal. An A3 is a piece of paper that is roughly 11 x 17 and walks through a process that identifies the problem, collects current conditions, sets a goal, develops a hypothesis and analyzes the outcome of an experiment, creates a process proposal, implementation plan and tracking of solution.

\3.    **Operations Research Problem Solving Process** – In operations research, this process is used and leads to development of a model to help guide the answer for implementation. The process begins with the situation which describes a problem to be solved. This flows into the problem statement which takes the situation and identifies constraints, objectives, data requirements etc…The next step is to build a model to try to come to a solution or answer to the question or problem. This could be through OR tactics such as a linear programming model or use statistical testing to answer a question. OR tends to use the model developed to help formulate the hypothesis. Next, a solution is derived, which is synonymous with the hypothesis. The solution is based on evidence from the developed model. Next, the solution is tested or experiments performed. A more complex model could be developed or the solution could prove to be effective. Last, the controls and procedure are developed and the solution implemented. Again, this process is driving the experimenter through a similar process where a problem is defined, a hypothesis is formed, tested and the results communicated or used to make a decision.

\4.    **Data Science Process** – This process is less formal than the earlier methods and is relatively new compared to the earlier methods, but important nonetheless. This process revolves around data, but it provides purpose to the data scientist. First is to define the problem or objective to be solved! Next, is to determine data requirements, availability and either refine the problem or collect the data. Then the data is cleaned to eliminate empty entries and formatted to be used in modeling. The data scientist then explores the data to understand the distribution, find any possible patterns and formulate how to use this data to solve the problem. Essentially, the user is forming a hypothesis at this step. Next, a model is created to either solve the problem or answer the question (prediction vs inference). The results are analyzed here to ensure the problem or question has been solved. Finally, the conclusions are written up and presented or a model is developed into a data product and implemented.

## Conclusion

While this has been a whirl-wind tour of methodologies, they are all pretty similar and stem from the scientific method. These methodologies are used to solve real life problems, find optimal solutions and generally make things better. In our later posts, we will review these methodologies in more depth individually, but it is important to see how they stem from and connect back to the scientific method where problems are identified, hypotheses are generated and then tested to prove whether or not they are true. This avoids costly mistakes incurred by gut driven decision making and seeks to optimize revenue that can be generated. Our next post will discuss the linear regression model as it applies to machine learning. 



# Turning ideas into reality by applying the scientific method

#### How IBM Consulting partners with IBM Research to transform our clients’ businesses

What does the scientific method have to do with business? Everything. Scientific thinking is needed in business and society to tackle business problem large, or small. And while you may not be a scientist, you can use the same approach if you study, hypothesize, test and iterate.

This method separates fact from fiction, grounding blue-sky thinking within the art of the possible. This is why scientific thinking is ultimately the basis for the development of today’s integrated solutions and the future we aim to create. A positive aspect of using scientific thinking is it requires embracing complexity, ideating both creatively and analytically, then persisting through experimentation as a path toward innovation.

Research is essential to the scientific method and it is what fuels ideas and invention and what inspires new thinking and ways of doing business. For over 110 years, research has been at the heart of IBM, acting as the foundation for pioneering new technologies and applying them to transform business and industries. Today, [IBM Research®](https://research.ibm.com/) infuses scientific thinking into everything it does to accelerate discoveries that will affect daily life, influence industry-innovation and guide government policymaking.

Under the umbrella of IBM, [IBM Consulting](https://www.ibm.com/consulting/) and IBM Research partner to bring competitive advantage directly to clients by applying research innovations, understanding client needs and challenges and by using joint resources to uncover first of a kind ideas to hypothesize and test.

From patent to solutions to deployment, this relationship accelerates the possibility for clients by providing access to advanced capabilities not yet available on the market. IBM Research provides ground-breaking research in AI, hybrid cloud, quantum computing, edge computing, sustainability and more, and IBM Consulting is using the products of that research to deliver innovation and differentiation for our clients to provide first-mover advantage.

For example, IBM and Boston Dynamics asked the question: Can plant data be safely collected and analyzed at the edge? Could the two companies help eliminate the need for personnel to manually collect data or put themselves in harm’s way on factory floors, while reducing the requirement and associated costs of instrumenting every piece of equipment? The answer was a resounding “yes”… Boston Dynamics and IBM are bringing their technologies together to create an AI-based solution for Spot, the dog-like robot created by Boston Dynamics. Using Spot already helps eliminate the need to put sensors on every piece of equipment.

IBM Consulting uses the [IBM Garage™](https://www.ibm.com/garage) methodology in each of our engagements to guide us as we bring the right people together to apply the scientific method for transformative, innovative business. [Bestseller India](https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/bestseller-ai-ibm/) set a very ambitious goal: develop a totally new, bespoke platform with AI capabilities to support preseason design, planning, production and forecasting — essentially modernizing processes by empowering employees with technology…After months of work and iteration, the Bestseller India-IBM Garage team brainstormed 61 unique concepts for the platform — called Fabric.ai — which became the first AI-powered tool for the Indian fashion industry.

Keeping the scientific method core to business transformation, synthesizing this methodology with systems thinking, enterprise design thinking, competitive strategy and agile software development, is a powerful and robust approach to meaningful innovation.

# The Engineering Design Process or The Scientific Method

[The Engineering Design Process or The Scientific Method — Carly and Adam](https://carlyandadam.com/thecarlyandadam/the-engineering-design-process-or-the-scientific-method)

*The following is a guest post from* [Dr. Jacie Maslyk](https://twitter.com/DrJacieMaslyk)*.*

Within our classrooms, young learners are striving to be problem solvers, designers, and explorers. Some students are eager to code robots and others want to grow a vegetable garden. Some dream about designing and building skyscrapers while others want to know why the night sky changes. All of these topics (and more) are a part of STEM - the investigation of **S**cience, **T**echnology, **E**ngineering, and **M**ath.

## **Engineering Design Process vs. The Scientific Method**

STEM learning is an opportunity to engage students in lessons that prompt them to think, plan, experiment, and invent. Our goal as educators is to support them in this process and create lessons that offer the opportunity to build new skills. The big question when exploring these types of hands-on learning opportunities with our students is “What framework should I use, the Engineering Design Process or the Scientific Method?”

## **What is the** **Engineering Design Process?**

[The Engineering Design Process](https://carlyandadam.com/thecarlyandadam/what-is-the-engineering-design-process-and-how-do-you-teach-it) (also called the Engineering Design Cycle) is a series of steps that engineers work through to identify and solve problems.

![img](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/589f5ac0b3db2b3945379d79/1632836411600-IIG08XY3IEQA5OTRCXVV/Engineering+Design+Process+19.png?format=1000w)

- **Ask:** What is the problem that needs to be solved?
- **Imagine:** What are some of the potential solutions to the problem?
- **Plan:** Which solution seems to be the best fit?
- **Create:** What will I sketch or build to solve this problem?
- **Experiment:** Does my proposed solution actually work? 
- **Improve:** How can I improve my solution?

Choosing an engineering design challenge will push students to come up with possible solutions to a variety of problems using innovative thinking and creativity. In these challenges, students will use a variety of materials to create models and test them, often working with others and making improvements based on their feedback. For example, you might challenge your students to [build a windmill](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Design-a-Windmill-Spring-STEM-Challenge-with-TpT-Digital-Distance-Learning-3058503) with rotating blades.

[![img](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/589f5ac0b3db2b3945379d79/1632833708778-TD5OR0D3PHS7JUYL39Y7/Windmill.jpeg?format=1000w)](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Design-a-Windmill-Spring-STEM-Challenge-with-TpT-Digital-Distance-Learning-3058503)

Engineering design challenges tend to be open-ended and can lead to multiple correct solutions. In other instances, the topic or ideas that we want students to explore might require a different approach. We might use the scientific method so that students can experiment and learn about something in a more structured way.

## **What is the** **Scientific Method?**

The scientific method is another instructional method that we can use to have students explore concepts in STEM. Using the scientific method students explore a question using a series of steps. They make a prediction and test their hypotheses arriving at a final conclusion.

![img](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/589f5ac0b3db2b3945379d79/1632923042273-GIJJWPIMI3PULPYRIFVU/Scientific+Method+Fixed+STEM+Carly+and+Adam.png?format=1000w)

- **Purpose:** Ask a question about a topic that can be tested.
- **Research:** Plan your investigation.
- **Hypothesis:** Make a prediction about what you think will happen.
- **Experiment:** Conduct the investigation and collect data about what occurred.
- **Analysis:** Review your data and think about why.
- **Conclusion:** Explain what you figured out by exploring the topic.

The Scientific Method can be used with students at any grade level. It is a way to tap into curiosities and seek out information to build understanding. Used primarily in science, the scientific method can also be used in experiences that focus on math and engineering. For example, you may want to challenge your students to use the scientific method to determine [how many windmill blades are most efficient at harnessing the power of the wind](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/The-Boy-Who-Harnessed-The-Wind-READ-ALOUD-SCIENCE-Activity-TpT-Digital-5268603).

## **How are the Engineering Design Process and the Scientific Method the Same?**

These two models do have some similarities. Both require students to be active thinkers. Students must ask questions and search for solutions. Both pathways also require students to work and learn in a hands-on way. Both offer opportunities to communicate about the results for feedback. Both the engineering design process and the scientific method have steps that guide the learner through the process. Although the individual steps are different, both processes have similar goals and intended outcomes.

## **What are the Differences between** **the Engineering Design Process and the Scientific Method?**

There are a few minor differences between the two discovery styles. The engineering design process asks students to define a problem. The scientific method starts with a question. 

The engineering design process asks students to build a prototype, while the scientific method asks students to use an experiment to test their hypothesis. The engineering design process allows the opportunity to test and redesign. The scientific method allows students the opportunity to analyze the results. 

Although this is not always the case, the engineering design process often works well for teams of students collaborating to combine ideas and create a possible solution. The scientific method can successfully be used by one scientist or a pair of scientists working together.

## **In the Classroom**

Let’s take a closer look at how each model can be used around the same topic. 

A class of third graders is studying water. The teacher isn’t sure which approach should be used.

Taking the engineering design process as a pathway, students might be challenged to work together to create a device that can collect rainwater. After learning about conservation and the scarcity of water around the world, this challenge will bring STEM to life as they work together to solve a real-world problem. As students design their devices, they have access to a variety of materials and are given free rein as to what they will create.

On the same topic of water, maybe this class has explored the pH of water and they plan to test tap water, bottled water, and water collected outside after a rainstorm. The scientific method allows the students to come up with a hypothesis about the pH for each type of water. 

Using the engineering design process, students select a topic, choose from different materials, and generate their own ideas. Using the scientific method, students explore this particular idea around pH, testing their hypothesis and collecting data to answer their questions. Both discovery styles offer a successful path to learning.

## **How do You Know Whether to Choose the Scientific Method or the Engineering Design Process?** 

Having difficulty deciding whether to use the Engineering Design Process or the Scientific Method? There is no right or wrong choice. Different STEM educators choose different paths. It is up to you and your students how you would like to explore new topics in the curriculum. 

***But what if I choose the wrong one?\*** 

As your students engage in your intended lesson, you may find that a different model would have been better suited to this content and understanding. That is OK! What is most important is [building a culture for STEM learning ](https://carlyandadam.com/thecarlyandadam/7-steps-for-building-a-stem-culture-in-your-classroom?rq=scientific)that encourages students to learn, grow, and be adaptable together.
